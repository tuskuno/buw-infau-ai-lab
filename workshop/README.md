## Part 1: Setup (20 min)

### Start Claude Code

```
1. Open a terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or VS Code's built-in terminal)
2. cd to the folder where you want to create your project
3. Run: claude
4. Sign in with your Claude account when prompted
```

You'll see a `>` prompt — this is where you talk to Claude. It reads your files, writes code, and runs commands. You approve or reject each action.

### Set Up Playwright MCP (Optional)

This lets Claude see and interact with your browser — useful for debugging visual issues. Run this in a separate terminal (not inside Claude Code):

```
claude mcp add playwright npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-playwright
```

Then restart Claude Code (`/quit` and run `claude` again) to pick up the new MCP server.

### Create the Project + Build the Isovist App

This single prompt creates the project from scratch and builds the full isovist app. Copy the entire block into Claude Code:

> The full prompt is also available as a printable card in [`workshop/prompts/isovist-starter.md`](prompts/isovist-starter.md).

```
Create a Vite + React + TypeScript project called isovist-app.
Install three, @types/three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, and Tailwind CSS (with shadcn/ui).

Copy the GeoJSON files from ../ai-lab/workshop/data/weimar/ into the project's
public/ folder: weimar-buildings-3d.geojson and weimar-streets.geojson.
(If that path doesn't work, look for a nearby ai-lab folder or download them from
the GitHub repo: https://github.com/bauhaus-infau/ai-lab/tree/main/workshop/data/weimar)

- weimar-buildings-3d.geojson — 3D building faces
- weimar-streets.geojson — street center lines

IMPORTANT: Coordinates are from Rhino (via Heron), NOT lat/lon. Do NOT use a map library.

Build an isovist analysis app with:
1. 3D buildings rendered from the GeoJSON
2. Street network as lines on the ground plane
3. OrbitControls for camera navigation
4. An invisible ground plane for click interaction
5. Isovist visualization from a single viewpoint:
- Cast 360 rays (1° increments) from viewpoint on the ground plane
- Stop each ray at the nearest building footprint edge or max radius
- Draw the resulting polygon as a semi-transparent blue fill on the ground
6. White buildings on the white background, do not show plane grid
7. Click-to-place viewpoint with drag discrimination:
- Track pointerDown screen position; on click, only place viewpoint if pointer moved < 5px between down and up
- This prevents orbit/pan drags from moving the viewpoint
```

Vite gives you a local dev server with **hot reload** — changes appear instantly in the browser without refreshing. This prompt will take a few minutes — Claude needs to create the project, install dependencies, and write all the code.

### Sanity Check

Once the dev server is running, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. You should see:

- White buildings on a white background
- Streets drawn on the ground
- A blue semi-transparent isovist polygon spreading from a viewpoint
- Ability to click to move the viewpoint (without triggering on orbit/pan drags)

**Don't worry if it's not perfect** — if buildings look flat, the isovist doesn't appear, or controls feel off, just describe the problem to Claude and ask it to fix it. Paste a screenshot or error message so Claude has full context.

## Part 2: Orientation (10 min)

**What Claude Code does:**

- Reads your files, writes code, runs commands
- You approve or reject each action
- Talk to it like a colleague: *"make the background darker"*, *"add a button that..."*

**Key tips:**

- **Be specific** about what you want
- **Iterate** - start simple, add features one by one
- **If something breaks**, just tell Claude *"this broke, fix it"*
- **Use `@filename`** to point Claude at specific files

---

## Part 2b: Power-Up Your Prompts (5 min)

These optional tips help Claude produce more polished results. Skim now, refer back later.

### A) Skills - Claude's Hidden Superpowers

Type a **slash command** before your prompt to activate a specialized mode:

```
/frontend-design

Create a dashboard that shows isovist analysis results with charts and a 3D view
```

The `/frontend-design` skill shifts Claude into a design-focused mode that produces **distinctive, production-grade UIs** instead of generic-looking ones. It's the single biggest quality upgrade you can use.

### B) Prompt Tricks That Make a Difference

Drop these phrases into any prompt to improve the output:

| Phrase                                      | What it does                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `"use shadcn components"`                 | Polished UI components instead of raw HTML |
| `"use a dark theme with rounded corners"` | Cohesive, modern aesthetic                 |
| `"make it responsive"`                    | Works on mobile and desktop                |
| `"add smooth animations"`                 | Micro-interactions and transitions         |
| `"use Tailwind CSS for styling"`          | Utility-first, consistent design           |
| `"add loading states"`                    | Professional feel while data loads         |

**Describe the vibe you want** - *"minimal and clean"*, *"data-dense dashboard"*, *"playful and colorful"* all work.

**Use references** - *"make it look like the Stripe dashboard"* or paste a screenshot and say *"match this style"*.

## Part 3: Make It Your Own (75 min)

Your baseline isovist app is running from Part 1. Now the fun part — pick any extensions that interest you and ask Claude to add them. Here are ideas grouped by category:

**UI & Styling:**

- *"Add a dark sidebar that shows isovist statistics (area, perimeter, number of visible buildings)"*
- *"Use a gradient color for the isovist polygon based on distance from viewpoint"*
- *"Make the layout responsive with the controls in a collapsible panel"*
- *"Add a minimap in the corner showing a top-down 2D view"*

**Analysis & Data:**

- *"Color each building by whether it's visible from the viewpoint — orange if visible, gray if hidden"*
- *"Show a percentage: how many buildings are visible out of total"*
- *"Calculate and display the compactness ratio (area / perimeter²) of the isovist"*

**Interaction:**

- *"Let me right-click to place a second viewpoint and compare two isovists side by side"*
- *"Add an 'animate' button that moves the viewpoint along the nearest street"*
- *"Add a heatmap mode that shows visibility intensity across a grid of sample points"*

**Advanced:**

- *"Show how the isovist changes along a path — let me draw a path and animate the viewpoint along it"*
- *"Add a 3D isovist volume (extrude the 2D isovist polygon upward to the viewpoint height)"*
- *"Generate a visibility graph: connect all pairs of points that can see each other"*

Mix and match, or come up with your own ideas. The goal is to make something you find interesting.

## Part 4: Show & Tell (15 min)

Everyone shows their screen for 1–2 minutes. No slides needed - just show what you built and what surprised you.

---

## Part 5: Publish Your App (15 min)

Let's put your project online so you can share it with a link.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

Ask Claude:

```
Create a new GitHub repo called isovist-<your-name> under the bauhaus-infau
organization and push my code to it.
```

Claude will create the repo on GitHub and push your files. If it asks you to authenticate with `gh auth login`, follow the prompts.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo on GitHub: `https://github.com/bauhaus-infau/isovist-<your-name>`
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**

### Step 3: Add a Deploy Workflow

Ask Claude:

```
Update vite.config.ts to set base: "./" so relative paths work on GitHub Pages.
Then create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs npm run build and deploys
the dist/ folder to GitHub Pages. Put it in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.
```

### Step 4: Push and Go Live

```
Commit and push all changes including the workflow file.
```

After the workflow runs (about 1 minute), your app will be live at:

**`https://bauhaus-infau.github.io/isovist-<your-name>/`**
